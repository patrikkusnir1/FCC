// Reuse JavaScript Code Using import

import { add, substract } from "./21_math_functions.js";

// Add the appropriate import statement that will allow the current file to use the uppercaseString and lowercaseString functions you exported in the previous lesson. These functions are in a file called string_functions.js, which is in the same directory as the current file.

import { uppercaseString, lowercaseString } from "./21_math_functions.js";
